# Three-Way Traffic Controller

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the working process of a three-way traffic controller for a T-intersection using Verilog HDL code. The controller manages vehicle movements at the intersection, aiming to reduce accidents and improve traffic flow by controlling the traffic lights based on predefined states.

## Principle of Three-Way Traffic Controller
The aim of the project is to design a traffic controller for a T-intersection. The intersection has six possible states that guide the traffic flow through the intersection, helping vehicles move safely and efficiently.

## Hardware Requirements
- FPGA Development Board
- Traffic Light LEDs
- Clock Generator

## Software Requirements
- Xilinx ISE 14.7

## Installation
1. **Setup Hardware:**
   - Connect the Traffic Light LEDs and Clock Generator to the FPGA Development Board as per the wiring diagram.

2. **Xilinx ISE:**
   - Install Xilinx ISE 14.7 from [Xilinx official website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools.html).

3. **Upload Code:**
   - Write or paste the provided Verilog code into the Xilinx ISE.
   - Connect your FPGA Development Board to your computer and upload the code.

## Usage
1. Power on the system using the power source connected to the FPGA board.
2. The traffic light controller will start operating based on the state transitions defined in the Verilog code.

## Applications
- **Urban Traffic Management:** Helps manage traffic at intersections, reducing congestion and improving safety.
- **Educational Projects:** Useful for teaching digital design and HDL coding concepts.

## Advantages
- Reduces the risk of accidents at intersections.
- Improves traffic flow and reduces congestion.
- Provides a practical application of Verilog HDL in traffic management.

## Limitations
- Initial setup and hardware costs.
- Dependent on the accuracy of the clock generator and reliability of the FPGA board.

## Future Scope
- Integration with IoT for remote monitoring and control.
- Expansion to include more complex intersection types.
- Implementation of adaptive traffic control algorithms.
